## `corrplot` package

### Location
This package is located on CRAN:https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/index.html
as well as GitHub: https://github.com/taiyun/corrplot. 

### Vignettes
The `corrplot` package has one formal vignette located on the CRAN website: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html. It's a basic introduction to the package, including the seven visualization methods and three layout types of the correlation plot. There's also a section on reordering the correlation matrix, using different color spectra, and other ways to customize the correlation matrix plot.

### Applications
There are many example posts on twitter using the hashtag #corrplot. Some of the twitter posts are displaying data from #tidytuesday challenges and some users are displaying their own data.

### Review
The `corrplot` package is used for plotting correlation data and seems to be widely used among R users. I don't know of any other R package that creates correlation matrix plots. Since the package is located on CRAN, as well as GitHub, it must be very robust and well-tested. I like how easy it is to use the package (you don't have to enter a lot of arguments to get a beautiful plot). I think I'll have to spend more time using the package before I have things to improve about it. Yes, I would recommend this package to someone else, especially with the vignette to help.
